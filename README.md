# State of the app

## React Native App

This repository contains a working React Native app. It displays the status of the user `In crisis` / `Not in crisis`
as well as a list of contact, guidelines and history of crisises.

The application fetches a json wich contains:
- `heartrate`: contains the heartrate value with its associated timestamp
- `position`: contains a `[x,y,z]` vector which contains the movement values with its associated timestamp.

Currently, we are using the heartrate to flag a crisis if there is a difference of more than 10 between two values.

# Work to be done

The app currently does not use the `position` values. It could be done to identify the movement of the hand and detect
the crisis more precisely.
